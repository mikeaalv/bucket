The perl script bucket.pl can be used to judge whether the buckets can be summed to get the number. In this process buckets can be used repeatly.If a subsets of buckets can be used to get the number, the program will return 1. If it cannot, 0 will be returned.

1. Environment
It is a perl script. I have try it in Linux or OS X, it works fine.
2. Usage
in bash
	chmod +x bucket.pl
	./bucket.pl <buckets> <number>
example:

	1 will be returned.
	./bucket.pl 3,7,11,13 30070955
	1 will be returned.
	./bucket.pl 11,13 119
	0 will be returned.
3. test
The test_bucket.pl file contains some tests of bucket.pl. 
The test_result.o contains the results of these tests.
